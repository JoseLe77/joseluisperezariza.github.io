Hello,

My name is Jose Luis, and I am a professional with more than 10 years of experience in the logistics and technology sector.

In my professional career I have played various roles, from operational positions to leadership positions, which has allowed me to develop a comprehensive vision of the supply chain and a deep understanding of the technological needs of the sector.

I currently work as an IT Solutions Specialist at DHL, where I am responsible for the management and configuration of the WMS Blueyonder (JDA).

Throughout my career, I have acquired solid experience in the administration of Oracle DB, SQL Server and Azure DB databases.

I also have skills in creating reports with Jaspersoft Studio and creating labels with ZPL language, as well as business analysis with Power BI Reports.

Before my experience at DHL, I worked at ID LOGISTICS, where I started as an Administrative Assistant in the Reengineering and Processes Department. Later, I was promoted to Supervisor, where I managed and configured the INFOLOG WMS System and led the Administration and Stock Management departments.

I would like to take this opportunity to point out that in both companies I actively participated in warehouse start-ups for new clients, transfers and Warehouse Management System Migrations.

I am a highly motivated person, with excellent communication and teamwork skills. I am passionate about technology and its application in logistics to optimize processes and improve efficiency.

I am sure that my skills and experience make me a valuable asset for any company in the sector.

Kind regards.
